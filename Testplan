Test scenario

	write test: done
	read test
	write until full signal is asserted: 
		TB should report # of writes, time and cycle when full asserted
		reject further writing
	read until empty: 
		TB should report # of reads, empty signal and reject further reading

	simultaneously write and read
		TB should report wptr and rptr, and compare if data are matched
		randomize clk, different clk vs same clk


	full and empty mutually exclusive:


	full and empty assert at the same time: deactivate rclk and keep writing until full


	***************************************************************************************
	Reset behavior

		-> Initial Reset


		-> Reset while writing
			TB reports wptr and full signal, as well as data
		-> Reset while reading
			TB reports rptr and read signal while reset asserted


Constraint-driven random test

	1. Random wclk / rclk ratio

	2. Random data

	3. Random
